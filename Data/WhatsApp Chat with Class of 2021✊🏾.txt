TOPIC: GOD WILL HELP YOU

MEMORISE:
“Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.” - (Isaiah 41:10)

READ: Isaiah 41:10-14 (KJV)

MESSAGE:
The best thing that can ever happen to anyone is for God to decide to help him or her. When God decides to help you, there is nothing that can stand in the way of you fulfilling destiny. When it comes to resources, He said in Haggai 2:8:
The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.

He also has influence in the highest places possible as we see in Proverbs 21:1:
The king’s heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

If not for God in my life, I wouldn’t be who I am today. When I gained admission to llesha Grammar School, we were to pay a deposit of 2 pounds, but my parents didn’t have it. One way or the other, God provided and I resumed in the school. By the end of the first year, almost everything in the house had been sold. By the time I had done 3 years in secondary school, there was nothing more to sell.

Just around that time, God brought somebody who had just returned from London to my village. Everybody went to celebrate with him. While everybody was surrounding him and rejoicing, he just turned in my direction and said, “Hello, little boy”. We began to talk. At some point, he noted that my command of the English Language was very good and I told him I was a student in llesha Grammar School. He asked what class I was in and I told him I was supposed to go to Form 4 but there was no money. He arranged for the school fees for my 4th year. After that, my mother went back to the principal and said, “Now he has done 4 years, please give him his testimonial so he can go and teach”. The man said, “Out of 5 years, he has already done 4. He only has one more year to go; you can’t withdraw him now”. One way or the other, I finished secondary school, gained admission to the University and got on the path of fulfilling my destiny, because God really helped me.

I pray for you today; God will move everything that needs to be moved for you to fulfil your destiny, in Jesus’ name.

PRAYER POINT:
Father, You helped Pastor Adeboye. You are no respecter of persons; please help me too.

BIBLE IN ONE YEAR:
Psalms 70-71

TOPIC: JOY UNSPEAKABLE

MEMORISE:
“Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:” - (1 Peter 1:8)

READ: 1 Corinthians 2:9 (KJV)

MESSAGE:
Many have heard the term ‘Joy Unspeakable’, but only a few have ever experienced it. That is the kind of joy that overwhelms you so much that you cannot find the right words to describe the experience.

Several years ago, we had a programme in a town called Ota in Ogun State, Nigeria. A lady who had been barren for several years attended the programme and later on asked that I pray for her and I did. Before she came to the programme, her in-laws had said, “If you don’t give our son a child within the next one year, you are out of this family”. The following year, we were holding another programme and there was a long queue of those who wanted me to pray for them; this woman was on it. When it got to her turn, she was silent and when she finally opened her mouth, she could only say, “Jesus”. The second time she tried to talk, she said “Jesus” and then she did it the third time. By now I was beginning to wonder what was happening, then she told me she was the barren woman I prayed for the previous year. At that point, I realised why she hadn’t been able to talk at first; she had given birth to twins and experienced ‘joy unspeakable’.

As you read this devotional today, I decree that you will soon experience joy unspeakable, in Jesus’ name.

Our memory verse today says if you believe in God, then He will make available to you joy unspeakable, full of glory. All you have to do is believe in Him. Believing in Him means that you act according to what you say you believe. James 2:17 says:

Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

Your behaviour must show that you believe in God. It must be that of one who goes to God believing that whatever he or she has asked for will be granted. James 1:6-8 says anyone who comes to God without faith should not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.

REFLECTION:
Be sincere with yourself: do you really believe in God? Do you really have faith in Him?

MESSAGE:
The Bible says it expressly that in the last days, many will be deceived by false prophets (Matthew 24:11).

Deception is when you present something that is fake with some attributes of the original, or you omit or remodel some truth into something completely different while ensuring that it still looks like the original. There are many Preachers today who doctor the truth to fit the message that they personally want passed without thinking about the consequences. What they don’t know is that they have been recruited by the devil to spread wrong doctrines. (1 Timothy 4:1) says:
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;

If people depart from the true faith of the Lord because of your message, then you are one of those spreading the doctrine of the devil. Always tell the whole truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Don’t tell your congregation that because Romans 8:1 says there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ, once they answer the altar call to surrender their lives to Jesus, they can continue committing sins and still be on their way to heaven. Add the rest of that verse to your message. The complete verse says: “who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit”.

1 John 3:6 says:
Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.

Thus the first part of Romans 8:1 means that those who will not be condemned are those who are in Him. According to (1 John 3:6), those who are in Him don’t sin and whoever sins has not even known Him at all. Don’t lead people to hell with your fake doctrines. Don’t tell them to disregard the Old testament and only pay attention to the New Testament when Jesus Christ clearly said that He did not come to abolish the law but to fulfil it (Matthew 5:17). Speak the whole truth to everyone you have the opportunity to preach the gospel to.

KEY POINT:
Preach the message of Christ, not that of the devil.

BIBLE IN ONE YEAR:
Psalms 83-86

Hymn 9 - I've a message from the Lord, Hallelujah!

We all know your passion and concern for everyone but please once there's a rule or a law in a place let not go out of bounds ma.

I share your interest but I also stick to the law of this room.. 
This is not the first time neither the second nor third,  but I will plead on your behalf in this room and be sure you will receive our law with Joy and Gladness..

Thank you ma for understanding 👍🏿👍🏿

I don't think there is anything wrong in what she sent judging from my perspective, since everybody have the right to perform his/her religion, then you can propagate it as well, we have xtians in the group that will benefit from what she sent, so why would you deny her of her right. Since she can not gragoon it on others.

Conversely, if it is Muslim too that think he has things that will benefit other religion cohort, he should go ahead.

Pls, do not let religion be an issue that will cause pandemonium. Some of us are aggressive and belligerent when it come to religion matters. Thank you.

Eid Mubarak 

Please, I need your help.

I am conducting a study on Nutritional Composition of Ram Meat and Implication on Consumers' Immunity Against COVID-19. 

I need 200 pieces of ram meat (100 fried pieces and 100 fresh pieces), for treatment and control, using experimental method.

A ram neck slaughtered by a selected Muslim 
here is also important to the success of this study

You are assured that the ram meat supplied will be kept confidential.

Lest I forget, 2 bottles of non acholic wine is to be added by each person, to be used as a means of Laboratory preservative. 

Thanks for your anticipated cooperation 🥴

Eid mubarak y'all.

Hope and pray for the best, and work our out in relative to whatever the output is.

29/08/2022, 9:47 am - +234 814 726 4110: In the beginning, she was.

We were top of so many sectors.

But that is history
29/08/2022, 9:47 am - Seun Daniel: It a lie bro 

Nigeria was never great 

Those times were the beginning of a country…You don’t expect something mew to start bad

29/08/2022, 9:50 am - +234 814 726 4110: Very true.

But it's not in our hands to change the story yet.

What I know we can do to effect the change presently is to focus on our individual growth, work hard and make money, pray if you believe in prayers, and vote for a better candidate in 2023 (doesn't mean all the problem will vanish though), then we move onto the next again
29/08/2022, 9:50 am - +234 905 960 6396: Be like say this Nigeria touch you this morning 😂😂

29/08/2022, 9:52 am - Seun Daniel: Tbh we have potential to be more advanced than Dubai but Africa as a whole is faulty..The reason European countries are always getting developed is cause of competition for neighboring countries but in Africa zero competition 😂😂
29/08/2022, 9:52 am - Seun Daniel: 😂😂😂
29/08/2022, 9:52 am - Simon MAT🚶: Uncle, have faith, even though na small faith na
29/08/2022, 9:53 am - +234 816 537 7962: I once had it. But it has been thrown in a moving sea
29/08/2022, 9:53 am - +234 816 537 7962: I think the hope I threw away is that which you find

29/08/2022, 9:56 am - Seun Daniel: That’s the bitter truth bro 
Africa as a whole is in the dark 
We’re ruled by greed and selfish set of individuals and the Europeans are not helping cause Africa has potential to over rule them if channeled to the right part
29/08/2022, 9:57 am - +234 905 695 8197: I guess you are going too far, make Nigeria better first
29/08/2022, 9:58 am - Seun Daniel: Let’s keep hoping

29/08/2022, 10:00 am - +234 814 726 4110: The darkness were talking about here is in the heart of almost every man, even those not in politics.

So, we blaming ASUU and FG also have people guilty of greed corruption and lack of uprightness.

The damage is so great now, that if you worry too much, oyo lo wa.

So we gats just chill, and act right.

Little talk, except it's a productive contribution, but massive impact on yourself, family, and society.

Even if e neva better for everybody yet, you go sure say you too don try

I just think if it's not agreed on, FG would have sued ASUU.

That means there's no law backing no work no pay.

I feel for our lecturers sha. They are parent too.

Then those who feed on student like drivers...

In short, one should learn how to turn negativity to positivity. No one has guaranteed us job after school, it'll be a good use of our time to learn something valuable too. 

May God help us all.

I will Dm you
28/09/2022, 6:33 pm - Qudus📚: yeah,

ETH ans DAI hold some constant relationship

the total ETH in DAI is equal to DAI

so, let x rep. the new ETH and y the new DAI

x×4000=y ----1(just like 2000×5=10000)

similarly

x×y=50,000 ---2

so, y=50,000/x

x×4000×x=50000

x²=12.5

x=√12.5=3.536

and y=50000/3.536=14140

Gentlemen and ladies, good evening.


It’s a been months .

How have you been?
How have you been winging it?

I do hope you are having productive time?

Sad as this may seem, the time  cannot be gotten back, so please try to make the best of it, may life be in your favour. Somehow, this is a window to life after school.

Learn a skill if you must,
Apply to that 9-5 job if you must.
Build your business if you must.
Invest in  your talent (career) if you must.
Volunteer to gain more experience if you must,
By all means, just do something.

And if you must, ask for help, I don’t mean money, you might be surprised what opportunities one can connect you to. 

For instance, if you want to learn a digital skill but genuinely do not have money for that, you can reach out to several “bosses” here, one might be able to help or atleast point you to the right direction.

In case you don’t know them, you can reach out to me on what you want to learn, there are people in this department doing amazingly well I can connect you to. I want to believe they will be willing to help. But more than them, there are resources one can connect you with.

It might seem like a somewhat long and lonely journey, but remember you’re not alone. 

It may not seam easy but I pray you receive everything necessary for the journey of life ahead. May the dice of life always roll in your favour.

Your colleague,
Patrick CHUKWU.
09/10/2022, 7:26 pm - Patrick Chukwu: 🔥🔥🔥

In other news, it gladdens my heart to remind us that this month is our assistant class rep @2349099382719’s wedding.

And like our class rep @2348167075453 earlier said, it makes sense that we support him 

And If you wish to support him in any capacity, you can always reach out to him. Not necessarily financially, a simple wish, prayer, text, call will go a long way.

There are several ways to support on such issues like this. You can remember him in your prayers and of course, and if you can support him financially as well, please do so.

PS: it is not in any way compulsory.

Thank you.

We hope to see you soon.

It's no more new that the price of everything has changed instantaneously. And it's no more new that we would be submitting our final project (4 copies) in a bit. Printing at the school park is now N20 by findings.

This is to notify my fellow colleagues that the printing will be going for N15 for Maths students only in the department.

Bother not with your final printing out, Abu Sofiyyah gets you covered.

So we are here by breaking it down to N13! It may seems insignificant but sight this example. A student has to print project of 100 pages in 4 places.

By

_K. O. Babalola_

One book introduction I read as a junior school boy, which has remained permanently in my memory, is the introduction to D. O. Fagunwa's "Ogboju Ode ninu Igbo Irunmole". He said (my translation):

"One beautiful afternoon, I sat in the frontage of my house enjoying the cool breeze of the noon when an old man appeared. He sought permission to sit with me and said he would like to tell the story of his life so that it doesn't die with him."

The above introduction may aptly fit for the short story of Baba Dr P. F. Olaolu. Though he didn't request he wanted it written so it won't die with him, but the japa trend of this age has compelled me to assume the role of Fagunwa in writing down Baba's story as he said it to me. Perhaps, the story may live after as he has passed on.

I finished in Obafemi Awolowo University in 1994 with the best result in my Department and Faculty and one of the top ten in the University. It was a first class in Mathematics, the fourth since its establishment in 1962. For that feat, I was given automatic employment as a graduate assistant, which I took up after youth service in May 1995.

The news of the great feat got to Baba Olaolu - an elder townsman - and he invited me for a honour's get-together. Present at the get-together were five of us: Baba mi, Buoda mi, Baba Yinka, Baba Olaolu himself and myself. It was a beautiful late morning. The day was bright. Baba had arranged a few wooden chairs and a long bench for our arrival. We took our seat and enjoyed the late morning breeze as we were served coconut slices, groundnuts and cups of water.

As we sat at the frontage of the small house, which could pass for a below-average salary earner's house, my eyes took a quick tour of the house as far as they could and there were no sights of attraction. The house betrayed the status of even an ordinary diaspora returnee, much less a full-career surgeon! Baba Olaolu had spent his full medical career life in diaspora. He had just returned home after retirement around the time I graduated.

Baba Olaolu sat with us on a wooden chair. He said to me:

"Omo mi, what is that you are seeing?"

He pointed to the ground. I didn't see anything that I could suspect he meant. So, I answered him in disaffirmation: nothing, sir.

"Is it not sand you are seeing on the ground?"

I said: yes, sir.

*"This is the sand you find anywhere in world. There is no place where currencies lay on the face of the earth for pick. So, if you need anything to take outside the country, please take it and return home to pursue your career. I see you having opportunities but don't be deceived by them. There is no place like home. I have been to places so many that if I tell you that the countries I have visited are more than I did not, I may not be exaggerating! I once worked as a consultant on crew to Radio Germany and they took me places all over the world. Here, I am.... This is what I wish to advise you. Keep it."*

We thanked Baba. We rose and departed.

Since 1995, I have kept Baba's words in front of me guaging my moves with them. Baba did not remember to say:

"I don't want my story to die with me."

He passed on years later. Before his death, he had resorted to farming in the village: not as a passion or pastime but for want of sustenance. Baba was well over eighty at death. In spite of his education and his revered medical profession, he had to  resort to farming in the twilight of his life just to make ends meet. Incredible! You may be asking why he didn't go into private medical practice. He wanted it and he actually tried, but he just couldn't afford such facilities he was used to in diaspora and he was such a principled person who would not dare kill a fly by accident.

That is Baba's story. In it are lessons to learn for the discerning mind. Baba lived his useful working life abroad and now he was back home advising against it! By any reasonable evaluation, the words he possibly held back from saying were that he has gravely regretted his (mis)adventure.

In December 2016, I was in Banjul for a conference with my boss - a Professor of Orthorhinolaryngology (Ear, Nose and Throat, ENT) - and I quizzed him: Oga, is it likely that a Consultant Surgeon in Nigeria would ended up farming later in life for want of food? Being a Muslim, he said: "Olohun o ni je ki a ri aburu." That is, except by the will of Allah, may Allah protect us, it is most unlikely.

Even as Baba did not request me to write his story, I owe him a duty to, most especially now, in this age and time that the wind of a madness called japa is blowing fast.

In Baba's words again:

"There is no place where currencies lay on the face of the earth for pick ... and there is no place like home."

O japarian! There are no free cents on the ground in America.

My one kobo advice.

21/11/2022, 3:50 pm - Patrick Chukwu: Good afternoon president

How are you doing?

There is no problem. All they need to do is to ensure that their supervisors sign the certification page and take it to the HoD's office for his signature, after which they will make additional 3 copies and insert the four in their projects.
21/11/2022, 3:51 pm - +234 810 541 7580: Meaning we no need examiner's signature again? Cus I don't understand
21/11/2022, 3:52 pm - Patrick Chukwu: From Dr. Yisa to students who were unable to submit to external examiner
🔥🔥🔥


Just sign your supervisor and HOD and make photocopies and submit like that.


No course for alarm, I guess.

Normally we're not supposed to see the results... But it's from COMSIT, not us.
Last year, someone from computer science created a link that gave them access to their portal without the awareness of school and when school knew about it, they took down the matric numbers that logged in and weren't allowed to graduate...
This is different, it was the main site that they themselves posted it, and they can't tell us not to access our portals nah

30/11/2022, 6:08 pm - +234 816 537 7962: Subject: Open position, New York University Abu Dhabi

Dear Colleagues,

The Mathematics Program at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) invites applications at the Assistant, Associate and Full Professor ranks in the broadly construed areas:

Geometry, topology and algebra. With a particular interest in quantum topology, differential geometry, algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.
Probability theory and related fields. With a particular interest in random matrices, statistical mechanics, Markov chains and stochastic differential equations.
Exceptional candidates in other fields may also be considered. The application deadline is December 1st.

To apply and for more details, please follow the link: https://apply.interfolio.com/115286

I am hoping that you can promote this open position in your network. Thank you for your consideration.
30/11/2022, 6:09 pm - +234 816 537 7962: From Prof. Jude Kong.

To: Black in Mathematics Association (BMA) Members 


My dear Blacks in Math brothers, sisters and friends,

 

I hope you are doing great.  I just learned of the position below and the deadline is tomorrow. Please apply and share. Here are some of the reasons you should apply:

The department of Math NYUAD is a super diverse department and the most friendly department I have ever seen.  Moreso, they are  looking forward to hiring a Black  Mathematician
The pay is higher than any salary I have ever heard of. I was surprised to hear that the starting salary for an assistant prof is almost double what you will get as a starting salary in Canada; plus a $4000 USD housing allowance every month. I can’t still believe this.
If you have Children, you equally get an allowance for kids, which is in addition to your monthly salary
Abu Dhabi is one of the cleanest cities I have ever visited.  NYU campus is super secure; you can leave your computer on your desk, go home and come back to it the next day. Unbelievable
Abu Dhabi is more progressive than most cities around the world.

Scholarships come in various forms. We have partial, full, studentship, Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, and  Tuition waiver et al. Also, scholarships from Universities, Governments, Organizations, and Individuals.

There is no clear compartmentalization between some of the scholarships, as some of them are interwoven.

Scholarships are often targeted at indigents/ academic achievers/ those that are helping their community.  Some scholarships can combine any of the three or standalone.

PS: Scholarship is not for only First class graduate. if you have a 2.2. you can win prestigious scholarships.
06/12/2022, 5:37 pm - Bolu👩‍⚖️: Slide 2

Getting scholarships is all about information; if you are not informed you'd be deformed. There are a thousand and one great scholarship opportunities around the world, but most of us don't know about them. You can get scholarships information from blogs, sites, school webs, et al. You need to plan ahead about the scholarships you'd like to apply for. Know the key dates (application start date and deadline) and the requirements; with these, you'd be able to have a workable plan. You can create an excel file to input list of scholarships you will like to apply for and their opening and closing date. This will help you keep track of every scholarship.
06/12/2022, 5:37 pm - Bolu👩‍⚖️: Slide 3

Before you apply to any scholarship, ask yourself, these three questions.
▪ Is the scholarship genuine? (There are many scammers who aim to exploit scholars) So it is your 
responsibility to find out if it is a scam or not
▪ Am I eligible?
▪ What are my chances?
As soon as you answer these questions, then, proceed to gather documents needed to secure a scholarship

Documents Required 
The documents required for scholarship application process include:

- Transcript/ statement of results 
- Proof of English test (IELTS, TOEFL, GRE or medium of instruction letter from your uni attestating that English is used as a medium of instruction during your study). In UK, some university accept a 
credit pass in your WAEC in lieu of other proof of English. I used my WAEC.

NB: IELTS is British oriented while TOEFL is US oriented but GRE is not English proficiency test. it is usually taken by people in STEM field for admissions and scholarships usually in the US. It's also optional for some schools in the US. You can get scholarship without writing any of these tests. 
It is all about information. I'd advise you to take the exam(s) *if required*, as it won't limit your applications. Also, don't rush to take any of the exams.

- Certificate ,if available (or notification of result) 
- Curriculum Vitae (CV)- Preferbaly academic CV.
- Published literature(s) (journals) (sometimes optional but it is an added advantage) 
- Two or three recommendation letter from a Professor, Associate Professor or any other lecturers that can write about your academic prowess. 
- International passport 
- Faith in Almighty God.

There are scholarships opportunities all over the world... You should decide with an informed mind...Not because your friends are going to the US, UK, Canada or this and that. Each country has requirements and discipline standards varies across the world.

Some US schools are leading in certain disciplines, same with the UK, Canada, Germany, France, Poland, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and other countries. Your decision should be based on your discipline ranking, University ranking, job prospect after graduation among other key factors to be considered. Also, you should apply for scholarships selectively, especially those with application fees. Don't waste money when you don't even meet the basic requirements...

Most scholarship applications are free* save for application fees,  don't pay agents to do the application for you...Well, if you have the cash to throw around, you can go ahead; and if you are not really after scholarships, you just want to leave the country.
06/12/2022, 5:37 pm - Bolu👩‍⚖️: Slide 6
How do you write the scholarship essay?

Usually a guide is usually provided in the scholarship application requirements. If they did, you should follow that. If they have not specified a specific format, then you can follow this simple outline when making your application/motivation letter: (1) Background/Key Qualifications, (2) Intentions for studying, (3) Expectations of the Course, and (4) your plans during and after the study. In making the letter, you should not just tell them why you need the scholarship but more importantly you should  explain clearly why you deserve to get the scholarship.
You can get a sample of this online by just searching on Google.
06/12/2022, 5:37 pm - Bolu👩‍⚖️: Slide 7

Preparing to Write Scholarship Essays

I have a friend who writes his scholarship essays 6 months before the scholarship opening and share with people for proofreading and adjustment. 

Please write, proofread, Proofread again, proofread again before submitting your write ups for scholarships. I advise you shard with scholars in your field who have won scholarships in the past.
06/12/2022, 5:37 pm - Bolu👩‍⚖️: slide 8
Yes, there are scholarships for direct PhD without masters usually in the US.

Direct PhD is not meant for first class graduates only in the US...It is all about how you can package your applications. Your experience, volunteering, online and offline courses also counts. 

In essence, scholarship application is all about planning and knowing your onions. Failure to plan and package your application very well will likely lead to rejection irrespective of your grade.

Something like:

Dear XYZ

We received applications from many qualified candidates like you but unfortunately we have applicants with better...🌚

I must emphasise that rejection mails are part of scholarship applications...You win some, you lose some. Your rejection mail is a testimony that you have tried but there are some useless rejection mails as a result of your own doing. Don't just submit for submitting sake...Submit a good application.
I got many rejection before winning three scholarships. I got 23 rejections then. 

it's normal but that shouldn't stop you from applying again. Reevaluate yourself and retire again.   

I'm laying emphasis on this because it is a normal thing...and you shouldn't back out when you are at the receiving end. Just imagine receiving a rejection mail thru DHL.

I came home from work, tired. I sat down on the sofa and put my feet up. My wife brought me a glass of water. My son gave me a sheet of paper and I read through:

English              17%
Biology              35%
Mathematics   40%
Physics             37%
Chemistry         42%
Economics       12%
Agriculture.      19%
Geography        22%

Suddenly, I lost my temper and started shouting: "What is this? All the time you are on the phone and TV! How dare you bring me such marks? How dare you?"
My wife said: "Be patient. Listen...." But I interjected, "Shut up! It's your love and pampering that have spoilt him. He is no good and never serious at all!"
My Wife said: "Oh?"
I shouted: "No one in our family has performed so badly, ever!"
My son said: "Dad, I am sorry I made you angry. I was cleaning the old cupboard and I found this. It is your old school report card, dated 27th July 1977 sir." I looked at the top and it was my report sheet. My name was boldly inscribed on it! 
I became humbled, gentle, and dumbfounded. Imagine the atmosphere afterward. Calmness in the air. With a foolish grin on my face, I replied, "Son, you know, in those days, food was scarce." 

😁🤣😂😆😜🤪

MORAL OF THE STORY

 As our children will be coming home with their report cards, let us sit down with them, talk and plan with them for next year's improvement. Let's not shout at or abuse them at all.
Stay blessed ✌️

```Good morning everyone. I believe your night was good?
Got to school, the HOD said he's not going to sign our clearance form because of the table in FG4, and this will definitely hinder us from getting signed from the faculty and dean's angle, now the plan, lets just pay that #1,000 for LA, we've liased with a carpenter and he said he's going to collect #12,000. We'd remove the fee from whatever we contribute. 


I want to beg us, only 22 people have paid and more than 70 students have submitted, don't let us wait more time to do this, once list is out on Monday, we can proceed on our clearance, and some of us have travelled.

If you don't pay, the secretary won't give you your form.

Please kindly pay your token of #1,000 to 0218153872(GTB)- Oloruntowoju Bolu.

```Good morning everyone. I believe your night was good?
Got to school, the HOD said he's not going to sign our clearance form because of the table in FG4, and this will definitely hinder us from getting signed from the faculty and dean's angle, now the plan, lets just pay that #1,000 for LA, we've liased with a carpenter and he said he's going to collect #12,000. We'd remove the fee from whatever we contribute. 


I want to beg us, only 22 people have paid and more than 70 students have submitted, don't let us wait more time to do this, once list is out on Monday, we can proceed on our clearance, and some of us have travelled.

If you don't pay, the secretary won't give you your form.

A tanker truck with 33,000 litres of PMS going to Enugu at a very high speed and another passenger bus carrying 18 passengers faced each other at Okigwe town in Imo state; the bus was driving on "One Way" lane.

As the tanker driver sighted the oncoming passenger bus which was also on top speed, he slowed down only to discover that the driver of the bus was his childhood friend. 

Both stopped their vehicles, greeted and wished each other Merry Christmas and Happy New Year in advance before taking off again.

The reason for the delay in the release of our graduating list is because the faculty is experiencing some technical issues with uploading.
They are working round the clock to ensure that this is resolved,  as soon as it is resolved the list will be out, so let's exercise more patience we can see it at any time.

```Good morning everyone. 
How was your night?

Information getting to me now that, someone misplaced our softcopy result and the reason it hasn't been sent to COMSIT.

So put your mind at rest, for more information, I'd ask Mr. Dopamu(FO) and get back to you guys. Thank you.

Stay tuned.

```Good morning everyone. 
How was your night?

Information getting to me now that, someone misplaced our softcopy result and the reason it hasn't been sent to COMSIT.

So put your mind at rest, for more information, I'd ask Mr. Dopamu(FO) and get back to you guys. Thank you.

Stay tuned.

28/12/2022, 5:55 pm - Bolu👩‍⚖️: It was 2:05 that day after I rushed from town to park

Professor Taiwo was in class, 300l then.

We have been gisted how strict professor Taiwo is but never had first hand experience except now. 

Welcome to the department of mathematics, I said to myself as I was still outside for the next 2 hours, mercilessly.

I found myself in this wonderful department where we have others watching their backs. 

Tosin and other scholars took their time, sacrificing to teach us during the day and night.

Bolu, always finding a way to intercede on our behalf for lecturers. 

Legend with his beautiful questions that are only understood by the scholars and those that want to become lecturers. Lol. 

And Embryo, the most lovely and humble individual in the set. Beyond the money is the gentleman that most people would love to emulate. 

Are we talking about the group of Alfas that work in groups

Or Abdulmajeed that married in level two.

Oh! Maybe the pastors with their smiles, wanting to help, with what they could have. 

This is the department I found myself in.

The air was pure for me to breath 

And it made the journey easy to beat.


Who is Uduak, tell her to call me?

This is the dime minute call we got.

I say; tell Uduak, if she doesn't call me, she won't graduate.


Fast fast, everyone was looking for Udi.

This was a voice of our L.A, 

More than an LA, he is just like a father. 

Always available to help us through.

Linking his students, with those that could help them

All he wanted was our success 

No time did we need him, but we found him around. 


Dr. Bello, is what he is called. 


So hefty, that his love could cover us all.

No one felt attack having him

Even if we'd dodge him sometimes, he'd still see us and smile. 

If there is something we have been blessed with, then it's having him.

He made himself so accessible, that you'd think we paid for access .

Millions can't repay his kindness.

Maybe this would spark some memories around. 


But guys, I want us to make this thing work. 


Let's use the little we can to say thank you. 

Send it in, send them in

Here is the account number it's a happy day

Let's bring happiness to our beloved LA. 

(Acct name: Oloruntowoju Bolu.
Acct number: 0218153872
Bank: GTB.) 


Then the one that wants to invite us should drop location

I dey route for una, my dear Alpha class. 


Sincerely yours.

30/12/2022, 6:49 pm - Patrick Chukwu: *President’s final address: and update from final year committee*

Dear member of *The Alpha Class,* 
congratulations to you— whether you graduated or not. It’s been a journey with its highs and lows. Memory has been made, calendars had been marked, and for so many of us, a milestone has been reached— BSc. in the bag. There is a new phase of life ahead of us all— one that will likely test you, try you and hopefully bring out the best in you. I pray the path ahead of you is pleasant. I pray you get tougher than life may ever get. I pray you have a future that is always better and brighter than your past.

Allow me send the spotlight on those necessary before I proceed with what the committee has to say.
First, our Level adviser. Thank you Sir @2348034334350  for all you do for everyone of us. You have my profound gratitude for a deepened relationship of many kinds;  first, as an amiable Level adviser, second as a staff adviser to the administration under my leadership, and also as a father figure in many ways. Thank you for your sacrifices and efforts towards us all, the ones we know of and the ones we do not have idea about. 

Also thank you @2348167075453 and @2349099382719. It’s been more than  four years of service to us all as Class rep and assistant respectively. May God reward your efforts by beautifying your path with blessings.

Serving the department as *president* is the best part of my academic year. I am grateful for the time and privilege.
My time  as president was as beautiful as the support I got from everyone here. 
Everyone was in one way or the other a part of it, however permit me to appreciate a few people who committed their treasure (cash), talent (skills) and time (sacrifice) towards the success— @2348100642636 @2347035058363 @2349131107598 @2348146369347 @2348141161177 @2348181726726 @2349067138914 @2348108630708 @2348165868201 @2349052588244 @2348127948516 @2349014944031 @2347080261191 @2349052778453 @2348173051147 @2349023548690 @2348085200935, @2347012595708 @2348187575976 @2349085658858 @2348101667854 @2349034638109 @2348147264110 @2349067399269 and many more who I may forget to tag. Thank you for everything 
To every fellow students, your cooperation and support is the best thing after CR7😂.  I have a proud relationship with most of you and I am grateful for that. 
My predecessors told me the biggest issue I may face will be from my level mate— disrespect, insults, divisions, etc.
Thank you for not making that my experience. I’d say I love you.  I am grateful for the open arms I got from every sect— the SUs, the Alfas, and others (na here we dey)😁. I appreciate the time we spent together. I hope the future unveil beautiful things for both of us. God bless you.
My DM is  open to you in whatever you think I can be of help. It will be a privilege to offer the ones I can or send you in the direction of who can. I might not be readily available but ofcourse, I am accessible.

*From the table of the final year committee*
Dearest colleagues, this is a conversation long overdue. In the spirit of  “a town-hall, different from ‘Balablu, …’ (you know the rest😅)”.  We will be having a WhatsApp or google meet call tomorrow . 

Highlight:
How far we’ve come, update on what went on and forthcoming plans.

I hope you’d make out time to hear us  and air your opinion and recommendations on our plans going forward.


Sorry about the urgency of the  notice.
We don’t want to carry this over the year.

🥂 to a better future.


— Signed:
*Patrick Chukwu*
*Your ~former~ president*
❤️ & 💡.
30/12/2022, 6:59 pm - Patrick Chukwu: Some memories we made were posted on this IG page:
https://instagram.com/thealphaclass?igshid=MWI4MTIyMDE=


We hope someday, in the short or long future, you can look back on this memory and be glad that you met us. We hope, when life get good for each one of us, you can look back and be proud our path crossed.

I am still hoping to keep this IG account alive. More creative things will be done with it. We’d keep our memories — our past, our present and our future. 
Get it updated with time.

We hope, we’d be able to create an exception as “The alpha class”. We’d create the beginning of a better story of a department bounded by love, support and togetherness even amidst our differences.

We hope we’d remembered to give back and throwback to the growth of one another.
I do hope, some day, when any of us is having a special day, we will be able to, collectively, be there for one another. That we will share in our collective happiness and progress in life.

Those not graduating now, of course, our thoughts are with you. You will forever remain members of the alpha class, any time, any day. Our journeys are different, sad as it may seem there is a reason for everything.

We are about to get into some new level you don’t want to miss out on.

@2349014944031 has been the one managing it for us, if you see that girl, help me hug her and squeeze some money into her pocket or pulse.

We have plans.
If you have ideas or suggestions , you can as well share with me.


One of the major things we want to do is, do a 
“How it started” vs “how it is going”

Like, a throwback picture of you in 100 level (probably matric, or anyone) vs (you after you graduate)

Post that and tag your account.
Details will be shared better later.

If you can, please be available for our meeting tomorrow.

I hope to answer every question regarding the final year committee progress and  plans during the call tomorrow.

Time: 4:00pm- 5:30pm.
Day: tomorrow Saturday, 31st, December, 2022.

I wasn't really surprised by the massive outpouring of love on me from my amazing students of my department,  as I have always known you to always come out in masses to celebrate me, especially with your kind words. 

I am truly touched by the sheer number of messages I received today, and I feel so blessed to have such precious friends as my students,you all mean so much to me. 

I thank you all for your tolerance in the face of my many mistakes, your everyday support that have kept me moving forward.

*INFORMATION IS POWER*

*2023 NYSC BATCH A HOPEFULS SHOULD TAKE NOTE*🔥🔥🔥

*NYSC mobilization process – Step by step*

Below are the process of NYSC mobilization exercise;

1. *Clearance in school:* NYSC mobilization starts right from this point. Graduates are expected to complete their final clearance in their respective institutions.

2. *Get your statement of results:* 
After completing your final clearance, next is to get your statement of results. Statement of results will be needed for registration in the NYSC Orientation Camp.

3. *Sign up for NYSC:* While waiting for your statement of result to be ready, you should proceed to register for NYSC at the Students’ Affairs Directorate in your school.

4. *Verify your name on JAMB Matriculation list:* It’s important to verify your name on the JAMB matriculated list. If your name is not on this list, you will not be able to register for NYSC.

5. *Verify your name on the Senate list:* Your institution will upload names of those who are eligible to serve on the NYSC portal. After they have uploaded the list, proceed to verify your name.

6. *NYSC online registration:* Only those whose names are on the NYSC Senate list will be eligible to register for NYSC.

7. *Print NYSC Call up letter:* After NYSC online registration, next is to wait for NYSC call up letter to be out. This letter will show you the state NYSC deployed you, date to report and other vital information.

8. *Get the required documents:* Make sure all your documents are ready, because you need them in NYSC Orientation Camp for registration.

1. *Clearance in school:* NYSC mobilization starts right from this point. Graduates are expected to complete their final clearance in their respective institutions.

2. *Get your statement of results:* 
After completing your final clearance, next is to get your statement of results. Statement of results will be needed for registration in the NYSC Orientation Camp.

3. *Sign up for NYSC:* While waiting for your statement of result to be ready, you should proceed to register for NYSC at the Students’ Affairs Directorate in your school.

4. *Verify your name on JAMB Matriculation list:* It’s important to verify your name on the JAMB matriculated list. If your name is not on this list, you will not be able to register for NYSC.

5. *Verify your name on the Senate list:* Your institution will upload names of those who are eligible to serve on the NYSC portal. After they have uploaded the list, proceed to verify your name.

6. *NYSC online registration:* Only those whose names are on the NYSC Senate list will be eligible to register for NYSC.

7. *Print NYSC Call up letter:* After NYSC online registration, next is to wait for NYSC call up letter to be out. This letter will show you the state NYSC deployed you, date to report and other vital information.

8. *Get the required documents:* Make sure all your documents are ready, because you need them in NYSC Orientation Camp for registration.

*The 2021/22 administration led by Chukwu Patrick Ifeanyi* came into office under the mantra *“raising leaderships’ standard”* and thanks to the amazing support of the lecturers, students and other stakeholders the administration played its part and had passed on the baton. 
Tomorrow, the end of the beautiful journey that started in May 2021 will  be celebrated in a remarkable  way.

You are invited to the *award and certificate presentation ceremony* of the 2021/22 administration of the department of mathematics, University of Ilorin, Nigeria. 

Over this tenure of service, impact was made, records were broken, mistakes were made, lessons were learnt, and people were empowered.

While the feat attained has been celebrated by so many people, we understand that this is undoubtedly due to the help of God, counsel of people (lecturers/alumni/colleagues) and support of amazing students. Tomorrow, we want to recognize each one of these people who served.

 Aside celebrating some lecturers, alumni and students whose sheer effort was a part of this success.
We will be learning from notable people whose experience and expertise will help you as a current student and recent graduate.
Do you want to :
- know who emerged the “Finalists’ lecturer of the year?”
- How many projects we did?
- Hear from some of the beneficiaries of our past projects?
- learn what it takes to be a remarkable student leader?
- Know some unpopular facts about the department of mathematics 
- Have final words, questions,  clarifications, commendations for any of the executives?
- Stand a chance to win some of our prizes?

Then join us tomorrow, to see how this beautiful story unfolds.

Time: 10:00am prompt 
Date: Tomorrow Friday, 13/01/23.
Venue: 1G4, Block 1 (Mathematics Department)

Featuring:
- Award sessions
- Guest lectures
- Games
- Prizes.
- Networking 
- Photo sessions (lots of them 😁)

```Good evening everyone. I believe we are all doing well.

Let's us go to school tomorrow for the completion of our clearance. 

But if you know you're not going for NYSC this first batch, you can slow down your clearance, for those I took theirs to the faculty, let's hope the faculty would be opened earlier so as the accountant should sign, please take all necessary documents with you to avoid delay, even at the students affairs.

Some of us are definitely going with this first batch. 

We have been stressed but the Lord is our strength, so just these few days, let's work it out together.

I love you all.```
15/01/2023, 8:30 pm - Bolu👩‍⚖️: Please *NOBODY* should come to my DM as regards this.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*The 2021/22 administration led by Chukwu Patrick Ifeanyi* came into office under the mantra *“raising leaderships’ standard”* and thanks to the amazing support of the lecturers, students and other stakeholders the administration played its part and had passed on the baton. 
Tomorrow, the end of the beautiful journey that started in May 2021 will  be celebrated in a remarkable  way.

You are invited to the *award and certificate presentation ceremony* of the 2021/22 administration of the department of mathematics, University of Ilorin, Nigeria. 

Over this tenure of service, impact was made, records were broken, mistakes were made, lessons were learnt, and people were empowered.

While the feat attained has been celebrated by so many people, we understand that this is undoubtedly due to the help of God, counsel of people (lecturers/alumni/colleagues) and support of amazing students. Tomorrow, we want to recognize each one of these people who served.

 Aside celebrating some lecturers, alumni and students whose sheer effort was a part of this success.
We will be learning from notable people whose experience and expertise will help you as a current student and recent graduate.
Do you want to :
📌 know who emerged the “Finalists’ lecturer of the year?”
📌 How many projects we did?
📌 Hear from some of the beneficiaries of our past projects?
📌 learn what it takes to be a remarkable student leader?
📌 Know some unpopular facts about the department of mathematics 
📌 Have final words, questions,  clarifications, commendations for any of the executives?
📌 Stand a chance to win some of our prizes?

Then join us tomorrow, to see how this beautiful story unfolds.

⏰Time: 10:00am prompt. 
 📆 Date: Tomorrow Monday, 16/01/23.
💡Venue: 1G4, Block 1 (Mathematics Department)

Featuring:
🔷 Award sessions🏅
🔷 Guest lectures👩‍🏫
🔷 Games🎮
🔷 Prizes🏆

18/01/2023, 8:39 am - Tosin🚬: A young man met this innocent Egyptian girl on Facebook and they became friends. 

He told told her that he a native of one of the gulf oil rich countries.  He expressed his interest in the girl and she also accepted.

 When the relationship went far and they both deep in it he revealed that he wasn't from any of the gulf states and he wasn't even a Muslim but was ready to convert to Islam in order to marry her. The innocent girl consented. 

The guy sent her $1000 for medical examination. The examination- per his introductions- covered kidney, liver, heart and blood.  The girl argued that blood examination was sufficient and that the rest were not relevant but the guy insisted so the poor girl did all and the results were submitted to the guy.  

Having confirmed the health-status of these organs the guy quickly sent her another $3000 Dollars just to convince her that he was genuine about the relationship and to cover-up his evil intentions.  

A date was finally fixed and the young man arrived in Egypt with a fake passport.  He hurriedly organized the marriage process, and quickly left with his newly wedded wife.  Then the unexpected catastrophe begun. All calls to know their whereabouts proofed futile.  Up to two- weeks the family couldn't reach out to the girl.

 The security was informed at this time. A week later, the police got in touch with the family to inform them that the girl had been found.  She was found dead and cut into pieces with all the parts she last conducted the medical test on absent. She was killed by the supposed husband and her kidneys + liver + heart taken off. 

The criminal was a member of international organization of criminals who are into selling of human parts. 

The medical examination he demanded was just to confirm that their victim's body parts were healthy and in good condition for business. End of story!!!

Those that have ears should hear and listen.  The real threat and enemy is with you now on social media.  Talk to your beloved ones.  Get the message across to your loved ones.  Share it with your children. 

 Educate them on the dangers of looking for love and relationships on social media, especially girls and particularly students amongst them. 

May God protect us all and our entire families.

See you all later by March, 2023 in your various states.

Unilorin senate list is out already, and those whose names are there have registrations already.

Our time will come and will bless us.🥹🥹🥹

26/01/2023, 7:23 am - Bolu👩‍⚖️: It simply means the list of people who were supposed to have graduated when the first list was out but there was omission or probably mistake somewhere, so when it was rectified or realized, then another set of list is been released.

It happened to about 3 of us in this department, but thanks to God for quick recovery😁.
26/01/2023, 7:25 am - Bolu👩‍⚖️: Go and collect it, even if you come next year, it's your thing only that it would have expired by then.😁😁😁

Coz either you like it or not, you are coming for convocation this October as the statement of result expires October, 2023.🌝

Thanks.

# Whatsapp-chat-analyzer

This is a simple web application that allows you to analyze your Whatsapp chat messages. The application is built using Python, Streamlit, and NLTK.

## Usage

### Running the application locally
To run the application locally, follow these steps:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Open a terminal window in the project/app directory and run streamlit run main.py.
- If you are stuck on the please wait screen, you can use the command in `streamlit run.txt`. This usually happens when you use github codespaces.
- The application should open in your default web browser.

### Using the application
Once the application is running, you can upload your Whatsapp chat file in .txt format. To export a chat from Whatsapp, open the chat, click on the three dots at the top right corner and click "More" -> "Export Chat". Choose the "Without Media" option and select "Email" to send it to yourself. Download the chat file from your email and upload it to the application.

The application will then display several visualizations and statistics based on your chat messages, including:

Total number of messages sent by each person
Percentage of messages sent by each person
Most common words and emojis used
